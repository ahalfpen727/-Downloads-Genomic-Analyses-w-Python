# A set of IPython/Jupyter Notebooks this include Secondary Analyses of Genomic Data
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##  This is a work in progress
This repository includes python scripts and notebooks that perform analyses of Sequence data previously analyzed in R. The scripts directory hold python scripts with functions that needed to be sourced in the analysis notebooks in order to maintain a reasonable length. The data directory holds most of the data required by theses analyses. The jupyter-notebooks directory holds the analyses themselves.
